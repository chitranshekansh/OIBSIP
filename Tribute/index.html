                    Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.

                    Lionel Messi shocked the football world with his transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021 and, after a quiet first season, he is producing some impressive statistics in his second campaign.La Liga rules made it impossible for Barca, amid their financial problems, to renew their star player’s contract and as such Messi was forced to move to PSG on a Bosman transfer. Messi won Ligue 1 with PSG in his first year with the club, but his debut season in France fell short of the huge expectations that surrounded his change of team.
                    The Argentine talisman joined PSG in August 2021 on a free transfer and has since represented the current Ligue 1 leader 62 times and has 28 goals under his belt. Lionel Messi has entered the history books yet again.
